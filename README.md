Testing, trying and learning html, js and css the hard way. 

Literally AI generated description, so don't expect this functionality. Atleast, any time soon, lol.
The “Kvartirochka” website is a web application that allows users to search, view, and book rental apartments in different cities. The site consists of several pages, designed using HTML and CSS, and contains interactive elements implemented using JavaScript.

The main page of the site contains the company logo, the main navigation menu, a search form for apartments by city, dates, and number of guests, as well as a block with popular offers. When entering data into the search form and clicking the “Find” button, the user is redirected to the search results page.

The search results page displays a list of apartments that match the specified criteria, with photos, prices, ratings, and brief descriptions. The user can filter the results by various parameters such as price, type of housing, amenities, etc., as well as sort them by different categories such as popularity, rating or distance. When clicking on an apartment card, the user is taken to the detailed view page.

The detailed view page contains complete information about the selected apartment, including a large photo gallery, description, features, reviews and a map with location. The user can also book an apartment by providing their details and payment method in a special form. Upon successful booking, the user receives confirmation at their email address.

The “Kvartirochka” website uses HTML to create page structure, CSS to set styles and decorate elements, and JavaScript to provide interactivity and dynamism to the site. The site is adapted for different screen sizes and browsers using media queries and flexboxes. The site also uses external libraries and frameworks to improve user experience and site functionality.
